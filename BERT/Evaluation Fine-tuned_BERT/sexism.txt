I feel that 'man-hating' is an honorable and viable political act
I haven't the faintest notion what possible revolutionary role white hetero- sexual men could fulfill, since they are the very embodiment of reactionary- vested-interest-power. But then, I have great difficulty examining what men in general could possibly do about all this.
To call a man an animal is to flatter him; he's a machine, a walking dildo
The male is a domestic animal which, if treated with firmness...can be trained to do most things
Life in this society being, at best, an utter bore and no aspect of society being at all relevant to women, there remains to civic-minded, responsible, thrill-seeking females only to overthrow the government, eliminate the money system, institute complete automation, and destroy the male sex
I want to see a man beaten to a bloody pulp with a high-heel shoved in his mouth, like an apple in the mouth of a pig
Under patriarchy, every woman's son is her potential betrayer and also the inevitable rapist or exploiter of another woman
Q: People think you are very hostile to men. A: I am.
Men use the night to erase us
The annihilation of a woman's personality, individuality, will, character, is prerequisite to male sexuality.
Men love death. Men especially love murder. They embrace murder as if life without it would be devoid of passion, meaning, and action, as if murder were solace, stilling their sobs as they mourn the emptiness and alienation of their lives.
Men are rapists, batterers, plunderers, killers; these same men are religious prophets, poets, heroes, figures of romance, adventure, accomplishment, figures ennobled by tragedy and defeat. Men have claimed the earth, called it 'Her'. Men ruin Her.
Rape is nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear
Politically, I call it rape whenever a woman has sex and feels violated
All sex, even consensual sex between a married couple, is an act of violence perpetrated against a woman
The more famous and powerful I get the more power I have to hurt men
Ninety-five percent of women's experiences are about being a victim. Or about being an underdog, or having to survive... women didn't go to Vietnam and blow things up. They are not Rambo
The proportion of men must be reduced to and maintained at approximately 10% of the human race
And if the professional rapist is to be separated from the average dominant heterosexual (male), it may be mainly a quantitative difference
If life is to survive on this planet, there must be a decontamination of the Earth. I think this will be accompanied by an evolutionary process that will result in a drastic reduction of the population of males.
Men who are unjustly accused of rape can sometimes gain from the experience.
As long as some men use physical force to subjugate females, all men need not. The knowledge that some men do suffices to threaten all women. He can beat or kill the woman he claims to love; he can rape women...he can sexually molest his daughters... THE VAST MAJORITY OF MEN IN THE WORLD DO ONE OR MORE OF THE ABOVE
I have little sympathy for men. I watch the handsome young soldier fall writhing to the ground with a bullet in his stomach and I look briefly and walk on. I don't even need to shrug. I simply don't care. What he was, as a person, I mean, what his shames and yearnings were, simply don't matter
All men are rapists and that's all they are.
I believe that women have a capacity for understanding and compassion which man structurally does not have, does not have it because he cannot have it. He's just incapable of it.
Probably the only place where a man can feel really secure is in a maximum security prison, except for the imminent threat of release
I feel what they feel: man-hating, that volatile admixture of pity, contempt, disgust, envy, alienation, fear, and rage at men. It is hatred not only for the anonymous man who makes sucking noises on the street, not only for the rapist or the judge who acquits him, but for all men.
There are no boundaries between affectionate sex and slavery in (the male) world. the dirty-laundrylist of 'sex acts'...includes rape, foot binding, fellatio, intercourse, auto eroticism, incest, anal intercourse, use and production of pornography, cunnilingus, sexual harassment, and murder
All men are good for is fucking, and running over with a truck
Women have their faults / men have only two: / everything they say / everything they do
Men, as a group, tend to be abusive, either verbally, sexually or emotionally. There are always the exceptions, but they are few and far between (I am married to one of them).
MALE:...represents a variant of or deviation from the category of female. The first males were mutants...the male sex represents a degeneration and deformity of the female.
MAN:...an obsolete life form... an ordinary creature who needs to be watched...a contradictory baby-man...
TESTOSTERONE POISONING: ... 'Until now it has been though that the level of testosterone in men is normal simply because they have it. But if you consider how abnormal their behavior is, then you are led to the hypothesis that almost all men are suffering from "testosterone poisoning.
I do want to be able to explain to a 9-year-old boy in terms he will understand why I think it's OK for girls to wear shirts that revel in their superiority over boys
We identify the agents of our oppression as men.......ALL MEN HAVE OPPRESSED WOMEN AND ARE THERFORE RAPISTS
Men are animals. Don't you think so?
We live in a culture that condones and celebrates rape. Within a phallocentric, patriarchal state the rape of women by men is a ritual that daily perpetuates and maintains sexist oppression and exploitation.
All men should be held in prison honestly
